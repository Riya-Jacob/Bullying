            <p class="text-color font">Researchers have known for years that bullying has lasting consequences, many of which are long-term. In fact, when kids are repeatedly bullied it can affect them emotionally and psychologically. For instance, they may experience low self-esteem, an inability to trust others, and have trouble forming lasting friendships. But the effects of being bullied are more than just emotional and psychological. In fact, research shows that there may be physical, structural differences in the brains of teens who are regularly victimized. What's more, these physical changes could contribute to mental health issues later in life, according to a study in the journal <i>Molecular Psychology</i>. <br><br> Aside from the bumps and bruises that occur during physical bullying, there are additional physical costs. For instance, bullied kids often experience anxiety. This stress on their bodies also will result in a variety of health issues, including being sick more often and suffering from ulcers and other conditions caused by persistent anxiety. <br><br> Kids who are bullied often suffer academically, too. Bullied kids struggle to focus on their schoolwork. In fact, slipping grades is one of the first signs that a child is being bullied. Kids may be so pre-occupied by bullying that they forget about assignments or have difficulty paying attention in class. <br><br> Kids who are regularly targeted by bullies often suffer both emotionally and socially. Not only do they find it hard to make friends, but they also struggle to maintain healthy friendships. Part of this struggle is directly related to low self-esteem. A lack of self-esteem is a direct result of the mean and hurtful things that other kids say about them.</p>
